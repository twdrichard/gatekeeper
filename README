Introduction
============

Gatekeeper is a command line PHP utility to help test website user access.
If you have multiple user levels it can test every page for every user
level to check who can access that page.
So for example you can check that only admin users can access the administration
pages.

Output is a csv file showing a grid of each page and each user level.
There's also a result of 0 for success or 1 for failure, so it can be automatically run
and every page checked e.g. at deployment.


I develop and maintain large site with a dozen user levels and hundreds of pages, so
Gatekeeper lets me check quickly if all pages are accessible by only their
intended users.

Website pages are defined in xml files in the data folder, specifying login account
details and pages to test.

The quickest way to get started testing your own site is to take one of the sample files
and add your own site details.
